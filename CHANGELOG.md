  - Automatically wraps `.cmd` and `.bat` files in `cmd.exe /c` on Windows
  - Fixes issue where Windows binary would spawn processes but produce no output
  - Direct `.exe` files are still executed without wrapper
- Enhanced error logging with detailed process spawn diagnostics
- Process exit status monitoring and reporting
- Warning when zero output lines are received from Claude process

### Added
- Platform-specific process spawning logic (`prepare_platform_command`)
- Comprehensive Windows deployment guide (WINDOWS_DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Windows fix verification guide (WINDOWS_FIX_VERIFICATION.md)
- Technical fix summary (WINDOWS_FIX_SUMMARY.md)
- Implementation summary documentation (IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
- Additional unit tests for Windows `.cmd`/`.bat` wrapper detection
- Process exit status logging for debugging
- Explicit warnings when processes fail silently
- Enhanced documentation for multi-platform Claude CLI detection
- Docker deployment examples with Claude CLI installation

### Changed
- Stderr messages now logged at ERROR level for better visibility
- Enhanced spawn failure messages with full command details
- Improved logging throughout process lifecycle
- README updated with platform-specific deployment notes
- Developer Guide updated with comprehensive Claude CLI path scenarios
- Clarified Docker container deployment with Claude CLI

### Documentation
- Added clear guidance for finding Claude CLI on Windows, macOS, Linux
- Documented auto-discovery vs. explicit path configuration
- Added Docker-specific deployment instructions
- Enhanced troubleshooting section with platform-specific solutions
