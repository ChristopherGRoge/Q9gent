# Windows Process Spawning Fix - Technical Summary

**Issue Number:** Critical Bug - Windows Deployment Failure  
**Resolution Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Affected Versions:** 0.1.0 (initial release)  
**Fixed in:** 0.1.1 (unreleased)

---

## Problem Statement

The Windows binary of Q9gent (`q9gent-windows-x86_64.exe`) would start successfully and accept HTTP requests, but failed to produce any output from Claude CLI invocations. Clients would receive only:

```
data: {"type":"completed"}
```

with no actual Claude responses, rendering the service non-functional.

---

## Root Cause

When Claude CLI is installed via npm on Windows (the standard installation method), it creates a `.cmd` wrapper script at:

```
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\npm\claude.cmd
```

Rust's `tokio::process::Command` was attempting to spawn this `.cmd` file directly as an executable. On Windows, batch scripts (`.cmd` and `.bat`) require explicit execution through `cmd.exe` with the `/c` flag.

**What was happening:**
```rust
// BROKEN: Direct execution of .cmd file
Command::new("C:\\...\\claude.cmd")
    .args(["-p", "prompt", "--output-format", "stream-json"])
    .spawn()
```

This would spawn a process that:
1. Exited immediately with code 0 (appearing successful)
2. Produced no stdout/stderr output
3. Triggered the `completed` event without any data

---

## Solution

Implemented platform-specific process spawning logic that:

1. **Detects `.cmd` and `.bat` files on Windows**
2. **Wraps them in `cmd.exe /c` automatically**
3. **Executes `.exe` files directly (no wrapper needed)**
4. **Uses direct execution on Unix-like systems**

**After fix:**
```rust
#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
fn prepare_platform_command(&self, args: &[String]) -> (String, Vec<String>) {
    if self.claude_path.to_lowercase().ends_with(".cmd") 
        || self.claude_path.to_lowercase().ends_with(".bat") {
        let mut cmd_args = vec!["/c".to_string(), self.claude_path.clone()];
        cmd_args.extend_from_slice(args);
        ("cmd.exe".to_string(), cmd_args)
    } else {
        (self.claude_path.clone(), args.to_vec())
    }
}
```

**Now executes:**
```
cmd.exe /c "C:\...\claude.cmd" -p "prompt" --output-format stream-json ...
```

## Code Changes

### Files Modified

1. **`src/agent.rs`**
   - Added `prepare_platform_command()` method with platform-specific implementations
   - Enhanced error logging with full command details
   - Added process exit status monitoring
   - Improved stderr logging (ERROR level for visibility)
   - Added warning when zero output lines received

2. **`src/api.rs`**
   - Added process exit status monitoring task
   - Enhanced completion logging to warn on zero output
   - Improved diagnostic messages

### Tests Added

- `test_windows_cmd_wrapper()` - Verifies `.cmd` file wrapping
- `test_windows_bat_wrapper()` - Verifies `.bat` file wrapping (case-insensitive)
- `test_windows_exe_direct()` - Verifies `.exe` files bypass wrapper
- `test_unix_direct_execution()` - Verifies Unix behavior unchanged

---

## Verification

The fix can be verified by:

1. **Log output:** Look for `ü™ü Windows: Detected .cmd/.bat file, using cmd.exe wrapper`
2. **Command logging:** Debug logs show `üìã Executing: cmd.exe ["/c", "path\\to\\claude.cmd", ...]`
3. **Functional test:** Simple requests produce `"type":"output"` events, not just `"type":"completed"`

See [WINDOWS_FIX_VERIFICATION.md](WINDOWS_FIX_VERIFICATION.md) for comprehensive test plan.

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå Windows binary completely non-functional for core use case
- ‚ùå All Claude CLI invocations failed silently
- ‚ùå No error messages to guide users
- ‚ùå Sessions created but never produced output

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Windows binary fully functional
- ‚úÖ npm-installed Claude CLI works out of the box
- ‚úÖ Both `.cmd` and `.exe` installations supported
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ Process exit status monitored and reported

---

## Backwards Compatibility

The fix is **fully backwards compatible**:

- Unix/Linux/macOS behavior unchanged
- Windows `.exe` installations still work
- No configuration changes required
- Existing session files remain compatible

---

## Performance Impact

**Negligible.** The only overhead is:
- One string comparison (`ends_with(".cmd")`) at spawn time
- One extra process in the call chain (`cmd.exe` wrapper)

Windows spawning overhead (~50-100ms) unchanged.

---

## Documentation Updates

1. **Added:** [WINDOWS_DEPLOYMENT.md](WINDOWS_DEPLOYMENT.md) - Comprehensive Windows setup guide
2. **Added:** [WINDOWS_FIX_VERIFICATION.md](WINDOWS_FIX_VERIFICATION.md) - Test suite for verification
3. **Updated:** [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) - Documented fix in unreleased section
4. **Updated:** [README.md](README.md) - Added reference to Windows guide

---

## Lessons Learned

### For Future Development

1. **Platform-specific testing is critical**
   - Windows process spawning has different semantics than Unix
   - Batch scripts require shell wrappers
   - Silent failures are the worst kind

2. **npm-wrapped executables are common on Windows**
   - Many CLI tools use this pattern
   - Always test with real npm-installed packages
   - Don't assume `.exe` availability

3. **Logging is essential for remote debugging**
   - Enhanced logging caught this in testing
   - Log the EXACT command being executed
   - Log exit codes and stream status

4. **Integration tests needed for each platform**
   - Unit tests passed but integration failed
   - Add CI tests that actually spawn processes
   - Test with real npm-installed Claude CLI

---

## Recommendations for Other Projects

If you're building a Rust service that spawns CLI tools on Windows:

1. **Detect file extensions:** Check for `.cmd`, `.bat`, `.ps1`, etc.
2. **Use appropriate shell wrapper:**
   - `.cmd`/`.bat` ‚Üí `cmd.exe /c`
   - `.ps1` ‚Üí `powershell.exe -File`
3. **Log the command:** Always log exactly what you're executing
4. **Monitor exit status:** Silent failures are hard to debug
5. **Test on actual Windows:** Don't rely on cross-compilation alone
